    is an Assistant Professor at Syracuse University's School of Information 
    Studies. In her research she has been involved with multiple projects that 
    investigated how diverse families with children learn about, engage with, 
    and use smart speakers in their homes over time. She has also led 
    participatory design projects with children with the aim of informing the 
    futures of voice agents for various contexts including in-home learning.

    is an Associate Professor at University College Dublin’s School of 
    Information \& Communication Studies. His research lies at the juncture 
    between psychology, HCI and computer science in investigating how 
    theoretical perspectives in human communication can be applied to 
    understand phenomena in speech based human-machine communication. He has 
    published widely on user centered issues in conversational and speech 
    interface interaction, is co-founder of the international Conversational 
    User Interfaces (CUI) conference series and has been involved in a number 
    of workshops on this topic at CHI and Mobile HCI.
