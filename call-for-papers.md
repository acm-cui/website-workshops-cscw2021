## Workshop aims and challenges

In this workshop we aim to particularly focus issues that are particularly relevant for children and families around CUI:

* Explore parameters and issues needing to be considered in designing CUIs for interpersonal spaces, such as people’s homes.
* Re-imagine CUIs as everyday computing interfaces.
* Examine key ideas around the appropriateness and design of tool-like voice agents and social-actor like voice agents that might also support inter-person collaboration.
* Understand the challenges in designing inclusive CUIs that accommodate and are sensitive to one's developmental stage, intersectional identity, and personal, social, and cultural context, specially in multi-party interactions in homes.

Furthermore, there are specific and timely issues that we wish this workshop to raise, including:

* What impact CUIs have on conversational habits, particularly those of children? 
* How (if at all) personalities should be designed for personified CUIs? How should one ensure that such CUIs are not creepy? 
* How can CUI (better) incorporate sociolects, i.e., non-standard dialects, such as Hinglish and African American Vernacular English.
* How can CUIs become a way for family members with low literacy or access to technology to interact with digital media and the Internet?
* How do parents and children organise and collaborate with and around these technologies?    
* How can interactions with CUIs, as always-on, always-accessible technologies, be regulated by parents?
* How could we design these technologies to support education and e-learning? For example, how can CUIs appropriately support children's in-home learning (e.g., by prompting reflecting instead of providing direct answers) while still keeping them engaged.
* How can parents and CUIs organise and collaborate in child rearing responsibilities? For example, what role can CUIs play to enhance or support children's after-school activities, or the learning of appropriate manners and behaviours? 
* How can we address existing CUI usability issues that limit accessibility to both general and underrepresented populations (pre-school children, children with mental or physical impairments, etc.)?
* How can CUIs support children by improving their mood and increasing positive emotions?
* How can CUIs enhance or support individual's personal health and well-being?
